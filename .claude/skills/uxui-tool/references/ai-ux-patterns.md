# AI/ML UX Patterns

Evaluate AI interface patterns including explainability, trust signals, error handling, and user control.

## AI Transparency Principles

### Core Requirements

| Principle | Description | Implementation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Disclosure** | User knows AI is involved | Label AI-generated content |
| **Explainability** | User understands why | Show reasoning/factors |
| **Control** | User can override | Edit, reject, feedback |
| **Feedback** | User can improve | Thumbs up/down, corrections |
| **Accountability** | Clear responsibility | Human review for high-stakes |

---

## AI Disclosure Patterns

### When to Disclose

| Scenario | Disclosure Required | Method |
|----------|---------------------|--------|
| AI-generated text | Yes | "Generated by AI" label |
| AI recommendations | Yes | "Suggested for you" |
| AI decisions | Yes | "Automated decision" |
| AI assistance | Context-dependent | Tool indicator |
| AI moderation | Yes | "Content flagged" |

### Disclosure UI Patterns

```
✅ Good Patterns:
- Subtle badge/icon near AI content
- "AI-generated" label
- "Suggested by [Product]" 
- Info tooltip explaining AI role

❌ Bad Patterns:
- No disclosure at all
- Buried in settings
- Legal-only disclosure
- Pretending to be human
```

### Disclosure Checklist

```
□ AI involvement clearly indicated
□ AI vs human content distinguishable
□ Disclosure doesn't interrupt flow
□ Consistent disclosure pattern
□ Accessible to screen readers
```

---

## Explainability Patterns

### Explanation Levels

| Level | Audience | Content |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Basic | All users | "Based on your activity" |
| Detailed | Curious users | "These 3 factors influenced..." |
| Technical | Power users | Model details, confidence % |

### Explanation UI Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Inline hint** | Quick context | "Because you bought X" |
| **Expandable** | Optional detail | "Why this?" link |
| **Tooltip** | Non-intrusive | Hover for explanation |
| **Side panel** | Deep dive | Detailed breakdown |
| **Confidence meter** | Uncertainty | "85% confidence" |

### Explainability Checklist

```
□ Basic explanation always available
□ Detail available on request
□ Language is user-friendly
□ Key factors highlighted
□ Uncertainty communicated
□ Not overwhelming
```

## Trust Building Patterns

### Trust Signals

| Signal | Implementation | Impact |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Accuracy indicators | Confidence scores | Sets expectations |
| Human oversight | "Reviewed by team" | Increases trust |
| Correction ability | "Edit suggestion" | User empowerment |
| Track record | "95% accuracy" | Builds confidence |
| Limitations | "May not be accurate" | Honest expectations |

### Trust Checklist

```
□ Capabilities clearly communicated
□ Limitations honestly stated
□ Confidence levels shown when helpful
□ Human escalation available
□ Error history transparent
□ No overpromising
```

### Setting Expectations

```
✅ Good Expectations:
"This summary may miss nuances. Review for accuracy."
"Suggestions based on patterns. May not fit every case."

❌ Bad Expectations:
"AI never makes mistakes"
"100% accurate" (without evidence)
"Perfect results guaranteed"
```

## User Control Patterns

### Control Types

| Control | Purpose | UI Pattern |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Accept/Reject** | Binary choice | Buttons |
| **Edit** | Modify AI output | Inline editing |
| **Regenerate** | Get alternative | Refresh button |
| **Feedback** | Improve model | Thumbs up/down |
| **Disable** | Turn off AI | Toggle in settings |
| **Customize** | Adjust behavior | Preference sliders |

### Control Checklist

```
□ User can reject AI suggestions
□ User can edit AI output
□ User can request alternatives
□ User can provide feedback
□ User can disable AI features
□ User can customize AI behavior
□ Controls are discoverable
□ Controls don't interrupt flow
```

### Feedback Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Complexity | User Effort |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Thumbs up/down | Low | Very low |
| Star rating | Low | Low |
| "Was this helpful?" | Low | Low |
| Correction input | Medium | Medium |
| Detailed feedback | High | High |

## Error Handling for AI

### AI-Specific Error Types

| Error Type | User Message | Recovery |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Low confidence | "I'm not sure about this" | Offer alternatives |
| No result | "I couldn't find anything" | Suggest retry/manual |
| Timeout | "Taking longer than expected" | Progress + cancel |
| Rate limit | "Please wait before trying again" | Clear timing |
| Model failure | "Something went wrong" | Retry + fallback |

### Error Message Pattern

```
[What happened] + [Why (if known)] + [What to do]

"I couldn't understand your request. 
 Try rephrasing or being more specific."
```

### Graceful Degradation

```
AI Feature ─► Fallback ─► Manual Option
    │
    ├─► Smart suggestions → Basic search → Manual entry
    ├─► Auto-categorization → Rule-based → User selection
    └─► AI summary → Truncated content → Full content
```

### Error Handling Checklist

```
□ Errors are clearly communicated
□ Errors don't blame user
□ Recovery options provided
□ Fallback to non-AI available
□ Retry mechanism offered
□ Support escalation path
```

## Loading & Progress for AI

### AI Loading Patterns

| Pattern | Best For | Implementation |
|---------|----------|----------------|
| Streaming | Text generation | Show words as generated |
| Progress steps | Multi-stage | "Analyzing... Generating..." |
| Skeleton + message | Content generation | Placeholder + status |
| Typing indicator | Chat | Dots animation |

### Loading Checklist

```
□ User knows AI is working
□ Progress indication for long tasks
□ Cancel option for long operations
□ Streaming for text when possible
□ Status messages for stages
□ Timeout handling
```

## AI Content Patterns

### Generated Content UI

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| AI badge | Disclosure | 🤖 or "AI" chip |
| Edit button | User control | ✏️ Edit |
| Regenerate | Get alternative | 🔄 Try again |
| Copy | Use content | 📋 Copy |
| Feedback | Improve | 👍 👎 |

### Content Generation Flow

```
1. User request
2. Loading state (streaming preferred)
3. AI output + disclosure badge
4. Control options (edit, regenerate, copy)
5. Feedback mechanism
6. Use/dismiss
```

## Conversational AI Patterns

### Chat Interface Checklist

```
□ Clear message attribution (AI vs user)
□ Typing indicators
□ Message timestamps (if relevant)
□ Copy individual messages
□ Conversation history accessible
□ Clear conversation option
□ Export conversation option
□ Feedback per message
```

### Conversation Design

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|---------------|
| Greeting | Set expectations, offer help |
| Follow-up | Acknowledge, ask clarifying |
| Handoff | Graceful transition to human |
| Ending | Summarize, confirm complete |
| Error | Apologize, offer alternatives |
